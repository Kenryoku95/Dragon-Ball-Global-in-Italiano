You will have to excuse me, I am simply an old man playing tricks for his amusement.[br]The only things I know about Kokkara Village are the battle facilities such as the [etc = \"5017\"]. They are separated into 2 categories. The [etc = \"5047\"]'s and the [etc = \"5048\"]'s. You could also include the [etc = \"5046\"] but you are not able to do those in public spaces like inside a village of city walls.[br][br]If you want to take part in the [etc = \"5017\"] you will need to go to the [etc = \"5049\"].[br]You can compete in the [etc = \"5047\"] format to increase your 1v1 skills while the [etc = \"5048\"] format helps you learn how to fight together as a team.[br]The only other thing I can think of that may be called a \"secret\" here is the Dojo.
