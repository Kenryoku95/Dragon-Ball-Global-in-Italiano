Through the efforts of my husband, Shime, I obtained magical drugs from Fortuneteller Baba and became a human being. But are humans cruel? I never thought that when I got older, I would become like this, a lot of people make cruel things because of my actual appearance. Although my appearance has changed, the mermaid in the photo is me, it doesn't change how I was, right? If you want to take a photo, I can pose for you, you can show it to the person who wants a new photo, he will see how that beautiful mermaid is now, I'd be glad if he didn't faint after. Hohoho.",
